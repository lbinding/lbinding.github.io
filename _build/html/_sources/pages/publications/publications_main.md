The brain is the most complex network known. Gone are the days where we would attribute a single cortical region to function. Even simple moter functions requires integration of several cortical regions to ensure we can move without injury. 

A network by definition requires connections, the brain is no different. In the brain these connections are known as white matter fibres; interconnecting cortical grey matter. Thanks to the advancement of diffusion MRI, we are now able to image these fibres whereas before it would require dissection. 

But what is diffusion MRI?
