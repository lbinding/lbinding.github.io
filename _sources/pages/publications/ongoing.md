# Ongoing Work

<p> I am currently developing several projects at various stages of completion. While I am unable to publicly share the code for some of these ongoing projects, I welcome requests for demonstrations of my work. Please feel free to reach out, and I would be happy to share these as examples of my efforts.</p>

## White matter fibre bundles and memory 
<p> In this project, we investigated the relationship between white matter fiber bundles and both immediate and delayed postoperative verbal memory. Based on our findings and existing literature, we propose a direct route for memory function, mediated by the Fornix, and an indirect route, facilitated by the Ventral Cingulum. This project is currently under review at Brain. </p>

## Dual SuStaIn 
<p> In this project, I have modified the existing SuStaIn software to implement dual model optimization. This initiative is based on the relationship between Tau PET imaging and cortical thickness atrophy, where we anticipate that Tau contributes to cortical atrophy. By modeling this relationship through disease progression modeling, we aim to uncover atrophy that is not accounted for by Tau, potentially indicating mixed pathology.</p>

## Residual SuStaIn
<p> Similar to DualSuStaIn, I am enhancing existing software to optimize residuals through disease progression modeling. This approach is based on the relationship between Tau-/FDG-PET imaging and cortical atrophy. By employing this method, we aim to improve the subtyping and progression patterns of patients with mixed pathology. </p>

## DeepSuStaIn 
<p> A challenge with zScore-SuStaIn is that the computation time increases exponentially with the number of biomarkers and the levels of abnormality. In this project, we aim to integrate multiple neural networks to enhance efficiency. Preliminary results indicate that models using over 20 biomarkers can achieve comparable performance while halving the run time.</p>

## Anatomically Targeted Automated Tractography
<p> I developed software designed to efficiently and automatically reconstruct connections between brain regions. This tool employed normative mapping to compare diffusion data from healthy controls with that of patients. As a result, it enabled the subdivision of tracts into their respective sub-fascicles. Our findings indicated that it reduced the need for manual interventions to less than 3%, in contrast to the next best method, which required manual input in over 60% of cases. Ongoing efforts are focused on expanding this normative database to include hundreds of healthy controls.</p>
