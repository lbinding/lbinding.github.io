# Introduction

<p>In my spare time, I have been developing my own game using Unreal Engine 5.4, Blender, and Quixel Mixer. Although it's still in its infancy, I've acquired several skills through this process and gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities involved in game development. This section is organized into several tabs that highlight specific aspects of my progress and the game's current state.</p> 

<p> The end goal is a sci-fi suvival horror game set on an abandoned space ship: "Playing as Wai, you have to retrieve the black box and return it to the company to understand why it went missing to begin with. What Wai does uncover, is worse than she could imagine..." This is largely inspired by Alien Isolation, Dead Space, and Alan Wake 2.</p>
