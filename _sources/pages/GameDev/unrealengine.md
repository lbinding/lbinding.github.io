    <p>The image above shows a debug level where I test all the functions in a controlled environment. This setup includes some custom-made assets (like the hallway where the character stands), an enemy, various sounds, and interactable objects such as lockers and doors. The aim is to refine each element in this debug setting so that building the actual levels will be as straightforward as possible (famous last words!).</p>

## Enemy AI

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>The image above demonstrates a simplified version of the AI system inspired by *Alien: Isolation*. In this setup, the enemy AI’s aggressiveness increases each time it investigates a noise or event, causing it to roam closer to the player and heighten suspense. Once a certain aggressiveness level is reached, a timer begins to gradually reduce the AI’s intensity, giving the player a brief respite and allowing the suspense to build up again.</p>

## Hide and Seek

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p>Since the enemy can roam close to the player, I’ve developed hiding spots where the player can wait out increased aggressiveness or situations where escape isn’t possible. The image above shows the player hiding in a locker.</p>
