Welcome to my website! 
This contains highlights of my previous work to demonstrate my preivous skills. Please see below for a brief summary of my career trajectory and members new and old of Bindings Brains ! Please see the links on the left to my publications and previous work. 

## Who am I?
 <p style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"><img src="../_static/img/Lawrence.jpg" height="140px" width="140px"></p>
    <p>Lawrence Binding (He/him) completed his undergraduate degree in Psychology and then went on to study neuroimaging for his Masters mainly focused on language and TMS. He joined UCL in late 2019 to undertake his Ph.D. focused on reconstruction of white matter fibre bundles, identifying relevant fibre bundles to language function, and processing them for augmented visualisation within surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy.  
    Upon completion, he undertook a 6 month postdoctoral research position focused on neuropathology correlations with computational MRI metrics and unsupervised machine learning in identifying subtypes of cognitive outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy.
    He then joined his current position at the Hawkes Centre (UCL) as a Computational Modelling and Machine Learning Research Associate. Here he focuses on unsupervised disease progression modelling techniques for patients with mixed pathology in Alziemer's disease. </p>

    <p> Vyte Janiukstyte (She/Her) joined Lawrence as a Masters student in 2021. Her focus was on mapping the anatomy and functional correlations of a fibre bundle known as the inferior fronto-occiptal fasciculus. She is now undertaking a Ph.D. at Newcastle University with Professor Peter Taylor. </p>
