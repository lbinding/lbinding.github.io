## Overview
 <p style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;"><img src="../_static/img/lawrence.jpg" height="140px" width="140px"></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 160px;">Lawrence Binding (He/him) completed his undergraduate degree in Psychology and his Masters in Neuroimaging. He joined UCL in late 2019 to undertake his Ph.D. focused on reconstruction of white matter fibre bundles, identifying relevant fibre bundles to language function, and processing them for augmented visualisation within surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy.  
    Upon completion, he undertook a 6 month postdoctoral research position focused on neuropathology correlations with computational MRI metrics and unsupervised machine learning in identifying subtypes of cognitive outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy.
    He then joined his current position at the Hawkes Centre (UCL) as a Computational Modelling and Machine Learning Research Associate. Here he focuses on unsupervised disease progression modelling techniques for patients with mixed pathology in Alziemer's disease. </p>
